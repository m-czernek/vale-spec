# Archived Repository

This repository is now archived. The [COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mczernek/vale/) now uses the https://github.com/daobrien/vale-spec fork as the build source. 

# Vale

This repository is a community maintained SPEC file for the 
[vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) command-line tool.

## Installing Vale

On Fedora and CentOS, you can enable the `mczernek/vale` COPR repository and install the `vale` package:

```

dnf install vale
```

On other systems, download and install the RPM manually.
You can either build the RPM, or download the RPM from the [COPR repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mczernek/vale/).
